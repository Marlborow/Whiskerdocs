╰─────────────────────╯
**DESCRIPTION**
Whiskerdocs is a headless program
that's meant to bridge the
gap between `LaTex` and `Markdown`.

Whiskerdocs works as a commandline
compiler program for `.wd` files.
these files can be written in any editor
of choice.

## How it works (2 steps)

`1.` Whiskerdocs first interprets the
user's source file and then creates a
HTML/CSS webpage from the content.

`2.` The webpage is then converted into
a pdf file.

### What makes it unique?

Whiskerdocs has a focus on producing
paper articles, novels and documentation
while keeping the syntax as simple as markdown.

Whiskerdocs supports
- Mermaid diagrams
- Mathjax
- ...
